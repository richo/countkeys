 logkeys keylogger - instalation instructions
===============================================================================

Provided your GNU/Linux distribution doesn't include logkeys package in its
repositories, manual installation of logkeys from source is as easy as:

 $ tar xvzf logkeys-0.1.0.tar.gz   # to extract the logkeys archive
 
 $ cd logkeys-0.1.0/build  # move to build directory to build there
 $ ../configure            # invoke configure from parent directory
 $ make                    # make compiles what it needs to compile
 ( become superuser now )  # you need root to install in system dir
 # make install            # installs binaries, manuals and scripts

That's it. If everything went through fine, you can probably start using it.

See README file for usage instructions and notes.


To install the binaries in path other than /usr/local/bin, use configure with
--prefix switch, for example:

 $ ../configure --prefix=/usr

Along with other standard configure options, you can also use:

 $ ../configure --enable-evdev-path=PATH

to have logkeys look for input event devices in PATH ( $(PATH)/eventX ) instead
of preconfigured default /dev/input (/dev/input/eventX), and

 $ ../configure --enable-evdev=DEV

to have logkeys define static event device DEV (i.e. /dev/input/eventX) instead
of looking for it in default /dev/input path or custom evdev-path.

The input event device we are referring to, here, is the kernel event interface
echoing keyboard events. If using either of these two --enable-evdev*
switches, make sure you provided correct PATH/DEV.
