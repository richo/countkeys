logkeys for Debian
------------------

Logkeys is disabled by default. Before using it you will need to set
DEVICE variable in /etc/default/logkeys. Check /proc/bus/input/devices,
for your keyboard and find line that looks like:

H: Handlers=kbd eventXX

Use value from above and set DEVICE to /dev/input/eventXX.
