Description: a keylogger for GNU/Linux systems
 Logkeys is no more advanced than other available Linux keyloggers, but is a
 bit more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it should never
 crash your X.  All in all, it just seems to work.  It relies on event
 interface of the Linux input subsystem.  Once set, it logs all common
 character and function keys, while also being fully aware of Shift and
 AltGr key modifiers.
